# movieInfo

This app works by retrieving data from the OMDb API. 

Use this app to learn more about a movie. After searching a movie by its exact title, the app displays the movie's poster, genres, actors, and plot. Clicking the "Movie Details" button opens the movie's IMDB page in a new tab.

Future Updates: Users will be able to retrieve a bunch of results using only part of a movie title.
